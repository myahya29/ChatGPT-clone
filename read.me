                 CHAT-CLONE-Hackathon PROJECT

This project was built by me specifically for a hackathon. 
The goal was to create a clean, simple, and functional **ChatGPT-style AI chat clone**
 that demonstrates real-world API usage, frontend logic, and good UI/UX.

##  PROJECT IDEA

The idea was straightforward:

> *Build a lightweight ChatGPT-like interface that feels real, works smoothly, and clearly shows how AI can be integrated into a web application.*

Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate:

* Practical API integration
* Clear frontend logic without heavy frameworks
* How AI can be turned into a usable product

##  FEATURES

*  AI-powered chat using **OpenRouter API**
*  ChatGPT-style user interface
*  Typing animation for AI responses
*  Chat history displayed in the sidebar
*  Option to delete chats
*  Start a new chat anytime
*  Fully responsive (mobile & desktop)

---

##  TECH STACK

* **HTML** – page structure
* **Tailwind CSS** – styling and layout
* **Vanilla JavaScript** – application logic & state management
* **OpenRouter API** – AI response generation
* ** API MODEL** -  "openrouter/pony-alpha"

##  APPLICATION FLOW

1. User types a message
2. Message is displayed in the chat UI
3. Request is sent to OpenRouter API
4. AI response is received
5. Response is shown with a typing effect
6. Chat is saved and shown in the sidebar history

## HACKATHON VALUE

This project demonstrates:

* Real-world API integration
* Clean and intuitive UI/UX
* JavaScript state management
* Converting AI capabilities into a usable product

It is not just a demo, but an **expandable base project**.
